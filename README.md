# Untitled Card Game

## Elevator Pitch

> As the sole propriter of an inn on the outskirts of a major city boasting a glorious citadel, you must expand your business while protecting it from other jealous innkeepers that would seek to destory you.

## Components

### The Deck

The deck consists of **heros**, **dungeons** (representing undistributed/unresolved equipment items), **spells**, and **traps**.

#### Heros and Citadels

+ Unholy City of Necromancy Theme
  + Citadel Leader is a Lich
  + Common heros themed as skeletons, zombies - necromancer stuff
    + Cheaper heros but allows the player to combine them later for more powerful protectors
+ Holy City of Cleric Theme
  + Citadel Leader is a Cleric/Paladin
  + Common heros themed as knights, holy warriors, the all really despise the Unholy City of Necromancy Theme
    + More expensive
+ Natural City of Druid Theme
  + Citadel Leader is a Druid/Nature based Creature
    + Fairies, animals, trees
    + Doesn't need a lot of gold
+ Industrial City of Dwarfs & Goblins
  + Cital Leader(s) are an alliance of Dwarfs and Goblins
    + Goblins cheapest, Dwafs initially more expensive
      + Goblins can upgrade equipment to make sweet ass goblin mechs.
      + Dwarven teams(?)

#### Dungeons

A dungeon is a vehicle meant to control the pace of the game and also allow players to adjust their relative power by finding equipment. In order to retrieve equipment from a dungeon a player must take a risk of leaving inn exposed by having either all of their heros or a chosen number to venture into a dungeon to **resolve** it. Resolving a dungeon awards the _player_ with a peice of equipment. All dungeons have a difficulty raiting corrolated with their survey cost.

A dungeon is laid during the same phase of a player's turn alongside hero placement.

#### Resolving a Dungeon

A dungeons difficulty rating can be broken down by:

+ Number of turns it takes to resolve
+ Overall constitution of hero(s) within the dungon
+ Special attributes of a dungeon (themed with award)

If a sent hero can resolve a dungon, it is considered _tapped_ and not available for the opponent's attack phase.

_An opponent can attempt to block the resolution of a dungeon in a few ways._

+ Laying trap cards on a enemy's dungeon causing the heros that are sent into them to be debuffed or injured (artifically increasing the dungeon's difficulty)
+ Sending their own heros into an enemy's dungeon to battle with enemy heros inside of a dungon.
  + This might be a really neat mechanic to "steal" another players equipment(?) It should be difficult and cost benifit generally awarded to the dungeon owner.
+ Attacking an enemy inn causing them to recall their heros from a dungeon leaving it unresolved.

#### Equipment (On the back of a dungeon card)

Equipment is theamed to a citadel (allow players to mix the hero base they choose and the equipment the heros wear) in order to create scaling in the form of buffs as well as temporary and permanent hero enhancements. Equipment also assists as a bit of 'RNG' control. If a player draws undesireable heros they can enhance them with gear they find by resolving dungeon. Likewise, if they have a lot of heros in their hand, the player may benifit from simply selling an item and using the gold to field more heros.

Only the owning player of dungeon knows what equipment is inside (indicative of the **survey** cost) leaving the opponent to have to guess of the relative worth of what the equipment is awarded upon clearing the dungeon.

#### Gold

Gold is the resource spent to field heros, survey dungeons, lay traps and fortifications.

#### Phases

Phases indicate points in the game that players are allowed to conduct actions. An action might be to lay a hero or dungeon, attempt to resolve a dungeon, attack another player's inn, or setup traps and fortifications.

1. Draw Phase
2. Hero/Dungeon Laying Phase
3. Fortification/Trap Laying Phase
4. Dungeon Resolution Phase
5. Attack Phase

Some spells may be phase agnostic allowing an inkeeper's hero to play them regardless of timing if resources allow.

## Example Playthrough

### First Turn

**Player 1** chooses the Necromany Themed Citadel Patron. They draw 7 cards consisting of 4 heros and 3 dungeons (random).
Necron house with no bonuses earns 1 gold per turn. The cheapest hero in Player 1's hand is a skeleton with a cost of 0. Player 1 fields their skeleton hero at no cost and ends their turn.

**Player 2** chooses the Industrial Themed Citadel. A feature of this citadel allows a player to start their turn with only six cards but 2 gold. Player 2 chooses to pay 1 one gold to play a goblin hero and another gold to **survey** a dungeon and ends their turn.

### Second Turn

**Player 1** Player 1's inn (with no modifications or enhancements) earns one gold per turn. Seeing that their opponent has already laid a hero and a dungeon, Player 1 chooses to use their gold to field a trap card on Player 2's dungeon and end their turn.

**Player 2** Determines that the equipment within the dungon is still worth attempting to resolve so they send their fielded goblin into the dungeon and taps it. The dungeon has a simple resolution condition of waiting for a single turn, but the trap laid by Player 2 increases that resolution to two turns. Since Player 2 does not have any other heros fielded they end their turn.

### Third Turn

**Player 1** Fields a dungeon by using their 1 gold income on paying the survey cost. Since they know that Player 1's only available hero is caught up resolving a dungeon and cannot defend, they choose to attack Player 1's inn directly dealing 1 damage and ends their turn.
